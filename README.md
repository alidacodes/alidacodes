## ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Alida! (she/they)

ðŸŒŽ I'm located in Ontario, Canada.

ðŸ’» I'm a Software Engineer at GitHub on Customer Success Engineering. I build and maintain support tooling, including GitHub's Support Portal!

ðŸ§° Some of the tools, languages and frameworks I use:

ðŸ’¬ I'm also a published speaker, and I'm particularly proud of my [Dec 2023 talk at YouGotThis.io](https://yougotthis.io/library/resiliency-treatment-resistant-depression-and-neurodivergence) on neurodiversity and mental health, two topics I'm very personally passionate about.

ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to volunteer my skills & contribute to Open Source in 2025; if you think I'd be a great fit for your project, please reach out!
