## 👋 Hi, I'm Alida! (she/they)

I'm located in Ontario, Canada.

I'm a Software Engineer. Previously, I worked at GitHub on Customer Success Engineering (2022-2025). I built and maintained support tooling, including GitHub's Support Portal.

Some of the tools, languages and frameworks I use:

  ![Ruby](https://img.shields.io/badge/ruby-%23CC342D.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=ruby&logoColor=white)![Rails](https://img.shields.io/badge/rails-%23CC0000.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=ruby-on-rails&logoColor=white)![JavaScript](https://img.shields.io/badge/javascript-%23323330.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=javascript&logoColor=%23F7DF1E)![React](https://img.shields.io/badge/react-%2320232a.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=react&logoColor=%2361DAFB)![Visual Studio Code](https://img.shields.io/badge/Visual%20Studio%20Code-0078d7.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=visual-studio-code&logoColor=white)	

I'm also a published speaker, and I'm particularly proud of my [Dec 2023 talk at YouGotThis.io](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Btw4FWlufQg) on neurodiversity and mental health, two topics I'm very personally passionate about.

### ❗ I'm looking for my next role! 

I'd [love to chat](mailto:hello@alidacodes.ca) if you're looking for an intermediate software developer with a passion for developer experience, internal tooling, and chasing tough bugs.
